{"doc": "prolonged drought, bark beetles and a rare fungus are drying out and killing brush and trees that surround many southern california neighborhoods, creating the potential for one of the worst wildfire seasons in decades, fire officials warned monday. a map released monday by the los angeles county fire department showed that some of the most vulnerable fire zones can be found this summer in chaparral-covered foothill and mountain-canyon slopes beside densely developed residential districts of los angeles and its suburbs. the map was released as the state department of forestry officially opened the region's 1990 fire season, which means its firefighting crews have been placed on higher alert and various fire prevention regulations are now in effect. while the fire-season announcement came only two to three weeks earlier than usual in the vulnerable foothills, it was a full two months ahead of schedule in the heavily wooded mountain terrain of southern california's national forests. \"the last really good rainfall was back in '82-83, so our brush really hasn't recuperated in seven years,\" said gordon rowley, a fire management specialist with the u.s. forest service. \"unless we get a hurricane or something -- and that's not very likely -- we're going to have a very bad year.\" rowley said other western states also are experiencing drought, \"which means they won't be able to send us the firefighting forces they normally can deploy out here. . . . it doesn't look good.\" los angeles, which has an annual average of 14.93 inches of rainfall, has received 6.18 inches so far this season, promising to make this the driest season in 30 years. the rainfall season, which runs from july 1 to june 30, is almost over for 1989-90, and southern california seldom gets much measurable rain in late may and the month of june. in 1982-83, 31.25 inches of rain fell on the city, more than twice the seasonal average. but since then, the annual rainfall here has averaged only 11.57 inches. rowley said the long drought has weakened the vegetation in southern california, making it more vulnerable to disease and infestation by pests. he said that with normal rainfall, pine trees are vigorous enough to fight off bark beetles, which bore into trunks and limbs to lay their eggs. he said healthy trees repel the insects with a flow of pitch that suffocates them and forces them out of the bark. but during the current dry spell, the trees haven't been able to produce enough sap to rid themselves of the beetles. rowley said the insects have proliferated, killing vast stands of pines and leaving tinder-dry fuel for fires. the problem is acute in the cleveland and san bernardino national forests. in foothill districts closer to los angeles, a fungus that preys upon drought-weakened brush has killed as much as 60% of the chaparral in some portions of the santa monica and san gabriel mountains. the fungus, first observed about eight years ago, attacks broad-leafed plants such as mountain lilac, manzanita and sumac, some of the more fire-resistant species of brush. officials said", "label": ["wildfire seasons", "southern california neighborhoods", "fire officials", "vulnerable fire zones", "fire prevention regulations", "wildfire danger", "high fire hazards", "fuel source", "vulnerable foothills", "prolonged drought", "rainfall season"], "stemmed_label": ["wildfir season", "southern california neighborhood", "fire offici", "vulner fire zone", "fire prevent regul", "wildfir danger", "high fire hazard", "fuel sourc", "vulner foothil", "prolong drought", "rainfal season"]}
{"doc": "another argument is that a citizen congress with its continuing flow of fresh faces into washington would result in better government than that provided by representatives with lengthy tenure. the counter-argument is that experience is an important characteristic for legislators. each viewpoint has some validity. presumably the best solution is to let the market decide, that is, to allow the electorate to determine the proper balance between freshness and experience. most of us would not want the government to determine whether a familiar or a new brand of toothpaste is preferable; why is a political representative different in this respect? many commentators bemoan the high tendency for incumbents to be re-elected. but if the electoral control process is working, so that officeholders conform with the interests of the majority of their constituents, then the electorate rewards its representatives with re-election. if the public voted against satisfactory performers just to install a new face, then officeholders would have less incentive to behave and the system would work badly. thus the main inference from a 95% re-election rate is that the political process is working and that officeholders are conforming to the wishes of their constituents. if we ever see a 50% re-election rate, then there really would be reason to worry. the threat not to re-elect works only if the incumbent is interested in another term, whether for his current or for another office. a problem with term limits is that it creates more lame ducks, who are less responsive to the desires of the electorate. much has been made of alexander hamilton's reflections on this point in federalist 72: \"one ill effect of the exclusion from re-election would be a diminution of the inducements to good behavior.\" (it is interesting to note, however, that hamilton was not discussing term limits on the legislature, and was actually arguing against the term limits on the chief executive that are contained now in the 22nd amendment.) the only respectable argument in favor of term limits that i know of refers to the legislature and involves the interaction with the seniority system. representatives accumulate more power as they become more senior, partly because of better committee assignments and more staff and partly because of increased familiarity with government officials and institutions and with outside interest groups. some aspects of this power, such as greater experience with governmental programs, are desirable; others, such as the increased ability to extract funds from interest groups, are not. even if seniority is a net cost in the aggregate, however, each district has an incentive to re-elect its own incumbent (and would if possible vote against the incumbents from other districts) because the representative's relative seniority translates into a large share of governmental largess. the voters would be better off if they could reach a binding agreement that precluded the re-election of incumbents, that is, if term limits were instituted. as an example, the voters of washington state recently rejected a proposal that would have limited the seniority of their congressional representatives relative to those of other states. yet the same", "label": ["legislative term limits", "executive term limits", "citizen congress", "officeholders", "re-election rate", "political process", "constitutional amendment", "civil rights amendment", "political representative", "electoral control process"], "stemmed_label": ["legisl term limit", "execut term limit", "citizen congress", "officehold", "re-elect rate", "polit process", "constitut amend", "civil right amend", "polit repres", "elector control process"]}

'poverty reduction must be the benchmark against which our performance as a development institution is judged,' he said. however, he failed to respond to demands from the clinton administration for the bank to set more precise targets for the proportion of lending that should have an explicit poverty focus. in congressional testimony this week, mr lloyd bentsen, us treasury secretary, said the us wanted to see more funding that 'will create social and economic safety nets' for poor people most affected by war, civil strife and economic mismanagement. 'we will look for specific increases in the share of lending going for these purposes.' in fiscal 1992, nearly half of all world bank adjustment loans failed to include specific poverty reduction measures, in spite of calls from mr preston to put greater emphasis on poverty relief. the share of bank lending allocated for 'human resource development' is still only 14 per cent, in spite of repeated calls from mr preston for an increased emphasis on investment in people. at a news conference mr preston said the bank was making progress: a decade ago only 5 per cent of bank lending went for human resource development and only 5 per cent of structural adjustment loans had a explicit focus on poverty. but he said the bank had a 'long, long way to go'. while he expected an increase in the share of bank lending aimed at poverty relief, he declined to set precise targets for bank staff. mr preston, however, does intend to take several new steps to sharpen the bank's focus on poverty. the bank will publish annual progress reports charting its progress in poverty reduction. it will also seek the participation of the poor in the design as well as the implemention of projects. 'we want this to become the norm for our operations in the years to come,' mr preston said. he also released a report, 'implementing the world bank's strategy to reduce poverty - progress and challenges,' that outlines progress to date. this highlights the diversity of performance on poverty reduction in the third world. east asia has reduced the proportion of people in absolute poverty from over 30 per cent in 1970 to 10 per cent. sub-saharan africa however, had seen an increase in poverty which now affected half the people in the region. mr preston said bank efforts to reduce poverty could succeed only if governments concerned co-operated. officials cited indonesia, china, mexico and el salvador as examples of countries that were co-operating well but declined to name poor performers. he said hoped for a clear signal from this week's meeting of the group of seven leading industrial countries that they would deliver on commitments for a dollars 18bn replenishment of resources for the international development agency (ida), the centrepiece of bank efforts to reduce poverty.", "label": ["third world", "developing countries", "lewis preston", "world bank", "poverty relief", "poverty reduction", "bank lending", "adjustment loans"], "stemmed_label": ["third world", "develop countri", "lewi preston", "world bank", "poverti relief", "poverti reduct", "bank lend", "adjust loan"]}

{"doc": "a major issue hanging over the 1990 census is resolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed overseas, but congress is arguing over whether to keep counting illegal aliens. the house blocked an effort tuesday to require aliens to be excluded from the census numbers used in house reapportionment every decade. but the question still may be raised in committee and in the senate. the national head count will be taken april 1, 1990. census figures are used to redistribute the 435 house seats among the states every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to local governments. the reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of house members from states where slow growth threatens to result in losses of house seats. most of these states are in the north, where growth has lagged behind that of the south and west. undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the south, west and industrial states like new york, and other states fear a loss of power to those areas if the aliens are counted. while aliens have been counted in the past, military personnel stationed overseas have not. the commerce department settled that problem by announcing it will work with the defense department on ways to count the 1.2 million to 1.6 million military and civilian defense workers who live overseas. the problem has been in deciding which states may count these people as residents. that has yet to be decided, but possibilities include counting the state where the person owns a home or the last state where he or she lived for at least six months. the battle over illegal aliens, meanwhile, was taken up both in committee and on the house floor. rep. tom ridge, r-pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban on counting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $5.8 million to run the state, justice and commerce departments next year including $800 million to take the census. the bill was approved 258-165 and sent to the senate. opponents noted the constitution requires house seats to be apportioned based on all the ``persons'' residing in a state. ``every census since the constitution was created has counted all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens,'' observed rep. don edwards, d-calif. ``congress is empowered to identify those to be counted'' in the census, responded ridge. the census bureau's $4 billion budget for the census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegal aliens, he said. rep. mervyn dymally, d-calif., charged the debate is really over population shifts that will lead to more house seats for southern and western states. ``pennsylvania, i don't care what they do, unless they go down to the southwest and bring the people back, they're going to lose a seat,'' said dymally. rep. tim valentine, d-n.c., said, however, that counting illegal aliens ``is not fair. it may be constitutional, but it's just not right.'' census officials generally have opposed any attempt to delete illegal aliens, contending they cannot determine who is in the country legally. asking people about their status likely would result in people lying", "label": ["illegal aliens", "1990 census", "census numbers", "house reapportionment", "national head count", "house seats", "census bureau"], "stemmed_label": ["illeg alien", "1990 censu", "censu number", "hous reapportion", "nation head count", "hous seat", "censu bureau"]}

'the bill that is on the books will work, given the right economy and the right support systems,' mr clinton said. advocates of welfare reform had been discouraged about the new administration's intentions, fearing that the centrist democratic emphasis on requiring welfare recipients to work or enroll for training might fall prey to left-wing advocacy groups concentrating on greater funding of existing programmes. these suspicions were enhanced when ms donna shalala, new secretary of health and human services, last month devoted only one sentence to welfare reform in a five-page statement of goals. with the onset of the recession, state revenues have been constrained while the number of welfare recipients has grown by 30 per cent. as a result, few states have been able to implement in full the act's requirement that welfare recipients take part in some form of education or training. mr clinton promised yesterday his reforms would be based on the principle that 'welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life'. there must be 'a certain time beyond which people don't draw a cheque for doing nothing,' he said. but at the same time people must be helped out of the welfare trap by providing them with continued health coverage, child care, and expanded earned income tax credits when they took jobs. many states have already embarked on far-reaching welfare reform programmes such as michigan's 21-point plan to strengthen families or new jersey's family development programme. mr clinton said he would let states experiment with such programmes, even when he disagreed with them.", "label": ["welfare reform", "welfare programs", "bill clinton", "president clinton", "family support act", "social safety net"], "stemmed_label": ["welfar reform", "welfar program", "bill clinton", "presid clinton", "famili support act", "social safeti net"]}

{"doc": "bank of boston corp.'s decision to treat its third world loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions, bankers and analysts say. domestically, the move reflects the competitive advantage that regional banks with large loan-loss reserves have over their big brothers in such money centers as new york, chicago and san francisco. internationally, it appears that it will be even more difficult for economically troubled developing nations to attract new bank loans. u.s. banks are increasingly splitting into two groups. on one hand, there is a small group of money-center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries. on the other hand is a group of regional institutions which, with relatively small exposure to developing countries, are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or, as bank of boston decided monday, to completely write off some loans as uncollectible. \"it's a parting of the ways between the money centers who are out to collect on their assets and the regionals who want to get out,\" says lawrence cohn, an analyst at merrill lynch &amp; co. the bank of boston decision \"may well drive a wedge between the money-center banks and the regional banks,\" adds james j. mcdermott, jr., director of research at keefe bruyette &amp; woods inc., a securities firm which specializes in bank stocks. \"it's created an enormous quandary for many money-center banks,\" mr. mcdermott says. actions such as that taken by bank of boston highlight a potential competitive edge that regional banks have over money-center banks. management could use their reserve position to emphasize stength when competing for deposits and banking business against larger banks. the reserve action also could make it easier for institutions like bank of boston to attract investors to their stock and other securities, bank analysts said. while the large banks are eager to remain competitive with such regionals as bank of boston, they also want to ensure that the regionals continue to lend to heavily indebted developing nations. earlier this year, bank of boston proved one of the more difficult regionals to corral into a $6 billion bank loan for mexico, according to new york bankers. now that bank of boston has reserved and written off most of its loans to less-developed countries, it's likely to be much less willing to join any such new efforts. that could add to the lending burden for the biggest u.s. banks. moreover, most of the nation's big banks couldn't afford to follow bank of boston's lead without crippling their capital, and reducing their common equity-asset ratios to unacceptably low levels. for instance, if manufacturers hanover corp. imitated bank of boston's action, it would have to add $3.13 billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only 0.69%, keefe bruyette estimates. in order to take steps similar to bank of boston's, large money-center banks would have to sell assets, shrink balance sheets and slash dividends -- and they show little sign of doing that. yesterday, manufacturers hanover announced a regular quarterly dividend of 82 cents a share,", "label": ["third world loans", "loan-loss reserves", "boston corp", "regional banks", "developing countries", "money-center banks", "u.s. banks"], "stemmed_label": ["third world loan", "loan-loss reserv", "boston corp", "region bank", "develop countri", "money-cent bank", "u.s. bank"]}

{"doc": "a french dc-10 jetliner with 171 people aboard experienced a powerful high-altitude explosion, possibly from a terrorist bomb, before crashing in a remote desert region of niger in northern africa, officials in france said wednesday. in washington, intelligence specialists said they believe that the jetliner may have been bombed by people seeking to retaliate against france for its recent actions in lebanon. for several months, france has played an active part in the lebanon crisis, attempting to broker a settlement between christian and pro-syrian forces. late last month, the french government sent a naval task force of five warships into lebanese waters as part of what president francois mitterrand called a \"rescue mission\" for several thousand french nationals living in the war-torn country. but the action was widely perceived as an attempt to provide protection and support for maj. gen. michel aoun and his maronite christian forces against syrian troops and muslim militias in lebanon. ever since, one intelligence official said wednesday, the french government has realized that its planes were being targeted for some sort of terrorist attack. the dc-10 operated by the french airline uta crashed tuesday after taking off from n'djamena, chad, on a flight that originated in brazzaville, congo. french military helicopter crews who visited the crash site in the desolate reaches of the sahara desert late wednesday afternoon found no survivors. included among the presumed dead was the wife of the american ambassador to chad. on wednesday, michel friess, a spokesman for uta, said that \"the wide surface over which the debris of the airplane has been found suggests a high-altitude explosion that leads one to think of a criminal attack.\" anonymous callers to the airline office in paris and to a western news agency in london claimed responsibility for the crash on behalf of the shiite muslim terrorist organization islamic jihad. the london caller linked the attack to the seizure of a shiite cleric, sheik abdel karim obeid, by israeli forces in southern lebanon on july 28. saying he was reading a statement from islamic jihad, the london caller declared: \"we are proud of this action, which was very successful. we would like to say the french are warned not to exchange information regarding sheik obeid with the israelis no more. we demand the freedom of sheik obeid, and otherwise we will refresh the memories of the bombings in paris of '85 and '86. long live the islamic republic of iran.\" however, the message made little sense in the context of france's limited role in the obeid matter. a more likely possibility, speculated terrorist experts and one intelligence source in washington, was a terrorist attack on behalf of pro-syrian muslim forces in lebanon. the french foreign ministry declined to comment wednesday about the possibility of a terrorist attack. \"the pieces are widely scattered, so it didn't crash on impact,\" a foreign ministry spokesman said. air controllers lost contact with uta flight 772 less than an hour after it took off from n'djamena. the sudden loss of contact was another explanation given by the french airline authorities", "label": ["french dc-10 jetliner", "powerful high-altitude explosion", "terrorist bomb", "niger", "lebanon crisis", "rescue mission", "terrorist attack", "crash site"], "stemmed_label": ["french dc-10 jetlin", "power high-altitud explos", "terrorist bomb", "niger", "lebanon crisi", "rescu mission", "terrorist attack", "crash site"]}

{"doc": "just try explaining what gatt, the uruguay round or blair house are all about - but us investors have adopted a sensibly direct approach to the north american free trade agreement: if congress passes the treaty next week, it will be good for the economy, good for us companies, good for the stock markets, and good for president clinton. their reasoning is quite simple. investors believe that nafta will lift corporate profits because in a more open trading environment between the three signatory countries the us, with its superior industrial productivity rates and better-quality products, will enjoy the greatest economic benefits. the expectation is that growth in us exports to mexico and canada will outpace growth in imports from its neighbours to the north and south. investors are not alone in their optimistic view of nafta. most wall street economists are pro-nafta, as are the majority of business leaders, if recent polls are to be believed. there is, however, the dark side of nafta to consider. what if congress votes no? investors fear that a rejection of nafta would have dangerous knock- on effects around the world, depressing share prices in the us, latin america and eventually europe, and endangering vital trade negotiations over the uruguay round. by coincidence, the day after next week's nafta vote clinton will be in seattle for a trade conference with leaders of asian pacific nations. if he arrives there fresh from defeat on nafta, the president's authority on trade issues will be compromised. investors' darkest fear is that a no vote on nafta would throw such a spanner in the works of world trade that it would lead to a new era of international protectionism, higher inflation and slower world economic growth. in this scenario, inflation would be the biggest concern of markets. many economists argue that the competitive forces unleashed by the accelerating collapse of international trade barriers have helped restrain global inflation. low worldwide inflation has kept bond yields at historic lows which in turn have boosted share prices to record highs in many markets. thus, any reversal in that trend - a return of trade barriers, higher inflation, higher bond yields, - could undermine equity markets that are already vulnerable to a sharp downward correction because of expensive stock valuations. then there is the political cost of nafta's failure to consider. although the president inherited the trade pact from his republican predecessor, he has invested a lot of his own political capital in getting nafta through congress. on paper, this should not be a particularly difficult task because congress is controlled by democrats. yet, opposition to nafta among democratic legislators beholden to labour interests is considerable. anti-nafta forces have warned that opening up trade with mexico will lead to a migration of american jobs south of the border, where wages are much lower. because the domestic labour market remains weak, this line has struck a strong chord with ordinary americans. the result is that the president faces a tough fight ensuring that the house of representatives votes to approve the treaty on wednesday.", "label": ["north american free trade agreement", "president clinton", "economic benefits", "open trading environment", "anti-nafta forces", "trade pact", "global inflation", "international protectionism", "investors"], "stemmed_label": ["north american free trade agreement", "presid clinton", "econom benefit", "open trade environ", "anti-nafta forc", "trade pact", "global inflat", "intern protection", "investor"]}

{"doc": "thus began another chapter in one of medicine's most bizarre mysteries, a tale of sick sheep and mad cows, cannibals and pennsylvanians, ancient life forms and a cat named max. the plot revolves around a family of brain diseases, probably variations of a single disorder, called spongiform encephalopathy. it is infectious, invariably fatal and as insidious as termites, sometimes eating away brain cells for years without detection before a critical mass is spongified. then, over a few months, motor control buckles and cognition crumbles. victims then die quickly, usually within a year. now, after decades of detective work, medical sleuths appear to be closing in on the molecular culprits behind the disease. their dogged pursuit won't nail a public-health enemy no. 1 -- the disease is rare -- but it may pay off in a big way because the findings could shed light on more common killers, including alzheimer's disease. the work also promises basic science breakthroughs. spongiform research already has raised questions about a cornerstone of biology and spawned a nobel prize. the uncanny nature of the disorder sometimes grips scientists with a kind of obsessive fascination, notes nih researcher d. carleton gajdusek. he should know, having chased spongiform leads around the globe for 33 years and won a nobel prize in the process. recently the fascination has taken on a more anxious cast as the disease has struck humans and animals with suspicious regularity in several places, underscoring a longstanding question: do people get the disease from animals? the question has burned with special intensity since scrapie, the form of the disease in sheep, jumped to british cattle a few years ago after they were fed ground-up parts of infected sheep. about 20,000 british cattle have been destroyed since 1986 in hopes of eradicating the spongiform \"mad cow\" disease, which makes the animals jittery before they keel over. a few weeks ago, the first confirmed case of mad cow disease outside britain turned up in switzerland. u.s. meat producers have reason to be anxious about this because the incidence of scrapie has been rising in american sheep since the mid-1980s, says richard marsh, a university of wisconsin scrapie expert. scientists agree, however, that the disease in animals probably poses little danger to people. scrapie has existed for centuries and \"the world is bathed\" in its infectious agent, says dr. gajdusek. yet sheep have never been strongly implicated in cases of the human form of the disease, creutzfeldt-jakob disease, or cjd. at least not until the poltar journalist and two other people died of cjd at about the same time in a rural, sheep-herding part of eastern czechoslovakia. when dr. mitrova, a researcher at a bratislava medical institute, heard of the unusual cluster of cases, she decided to investigate. from the first, one clue stood out like a bloodstain: \"almost all of the people are involved in raising and taking care of sheep,\" she says. the local cuisine includes a soup of sheep meat stewed in sheep milk. the area's equivalent of chicken soup for colds is sheep brain fried in", "label": ["mad cow disease", "british cattle", "infected sheep", "sheep disease", "altered protein", "cjd victims", "cjd cases", "infection"], "stemmed_label": ["mad cow diseas", "british cattl", "infect sheep", "sheep diseas", "alter protein", "cjd victim", "cjd case", "infect"]}

'he is trying to sort through the misleading information,' says his press secretary. as a member of the house armed services committee he expects the foreign policy implications of the nafta vote to weigh heavily in his decision. this argument carried little weight at saturday's rally. mr ralph dombrower a perot devotee, brought the results of an interactive computer poll showing a growing isolationism among american voters. 'the public is becoming less inclined to see the us as arbiter of worldwide human behaviour and wishes to get out of our foreign policy involvements,' he says. the virginia business community began a pro-nafta lobbying effort last march.

'whatever the administration sends to capitol hill with nafta, or if they don't send a complete package in these three areas, the congressional democrats will seize upon the deficiency - real or alleged, it doesn't matter,' said mr freeman. governor clinton is also likely to deem the pact the 'wrong kind of nafta'. the environment/farm/ labour coalition opposed to the nafta has prepared its ground well in the house. it now has 200 signatories to a resolution introduced by congressman henry waxman and majority leader richard gephardt which warns that they will not support a nafta that does not have strong environment or food safety provisions. fifty-seven of the 200 signatories voted for the president's fast-track authority and now may be moving over on the issue. 'there are millions more people who 'get' the nafta now,' said ms lori wallach of ralph nader's public citizen. 'they have been contacted by their local churches, labour unions, farm groups, environmental or consumer organisations. there is a new awareness of its costs and that has come back to their representatives in washington.' in the senate, nafta is threatened by a resolution introduced by senator don riegle, which would permit congress to amend the agreement in five areas.

{"doc": "supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path hurricane hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the south carolina coast. but hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science. forecasters at the national hurricane center used computer models to track hugo's path into charleston, s.c. ``all the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models,'' said thomas pyke, head of national oceanic and atmospheric administration's satellite service. pinpointing the exact point of hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters said friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation. ``overall, i think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where hugo would be so officials in south carolina could act in a timely manner,'' said research meteorologist colin mcadie. the real forecasting problem with hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into charleston. ``it is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that,'' mcadie said. ``we really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.'' the hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by air force reconnaissance. hurricane specialist gil clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships. ``we had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate,'' clark said. in the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites to obtain a global weather picture. information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night. using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the national meteorological center in suitland, md., send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane. to determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane. then they make an educated guess about the landfall. meteorology professor kerry a. emmanuel of the massachussetts institute of technology criticizes the current forecasting system. ``congress and the american people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true,'' emmanuel said. satellites can give a ``pretty picture,'' he said, but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path. ``most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job,'' emmanuel said. forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise. ``we have to remember that those models used are only guidance products,'' pyke said, ``and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path.''", "label": ["hurricane hugo", "hurricane hugo", "destructive path", "supercomputer predictions", "satellite data", "satellite pictures", "hurricane forecasters", "real forecasting problem", "forecasting ability", "south carolina coast", "landfall"], "stemmed_label": ["hurrican hugo", "hurrican hugo", "destruct path", "supercomput predict", "satellit data", "satellit pictur", "hurrican forecast", "real forecast problem", "forecast abil", "south carolina coast", "landfal"]}

'bill daley is no washington neophyte. clinton needs someone with political sense to move this thing through congress, and daley has the connections,' says a fellow washington lobbyist. opposition to nafta comes from core democratic constituencies, making it a potential political pothole for mr clinton. mr daley's talents have been summoned, insiders say, to convince moderate democrats to back the agreement. the president needs 218 votes in the house to ratify nafta. the administration counts 125 republicans in favour of the agreement. clinton ally and fellow chicago democrat, mr dan rostenkowski, chairman of the house ways and means committee, is expected to deliver the 20 democrats on his committee. however, mr rostenkowski is under investigation for improper use of his post office perks and faces an uneasy future. by rough count, mr daley will have to marshall 73 votes from democratic representatives of states standing to gain the most from the agreement: those along the border with mexico and those with big agricultural, consumer product, or manufacturing export interests. his", "label": ["north america free trade agreement", "president bill clinton", "free trade pact", "william daley", "grassroots opposition", "labor groups", "side agreements", "congressional support", "controversial battle", "anti-nafta campaign"], "stemmed_label": ["north america free trade agreement", "presid bill clinton", "free trade pact", "william daley", "grassroot opposit", "labor group", "side agreement", "congression support", "controversi battl", "anti-nafta campaign"]}

{"doc": "slovenes always had at least as much in common with their alpine neighbours as with their balkan partners in the former yugoslavia. since slovenia's declaration of independence in june 1991, the gap between the peaceful ethnically homogeneous new republic of 2m people and the war-impoverished rest of former yugoslavia has widened inexorably. 'we have been very lucky,' says president milan kucan, the wily former communist who led slovenia's drive for independence from the serb- dominated federation. but he, like mr janez drnovsek, the prime minister of slovenia's three-pronged coalition government, makes clear that slovenia suffers economically from the disintegration of yugoslavia and would be one of the principal gainers from a resolution of the bloody balkan imbroglio. 'slovenia's southern border with croatia has become the border between peace and war in europe,' mr kucan declares. a glance at the map shows what he means. at its narrowest point, only a 46 km- long strip of slovenian coast- line separates italy from the rest of former yugoslavia. austria is insulated from the war-torn regions of croatia and bosnia-herzegovina, both once ruled by the austrian habs- burgs, thanks to its own 324 km-long border with slovenia. but slovenia would hate to be perceived merely as a convenient cordon sanitaire. the new karavanke road tunnel beneath the alps, completed just before the 10-day war between slovenia and the yugoslav army which immediately followed indep- endence, has underlined slovenia's traditional importance as a transit route. the railways and the motorway leading south through the capital ljubljana to the slovenian port of koper and its italian neighbour trieste carry freight and travellers heading to and from central europe and the adriatic sea. the highway is also thick with aid trucks and an ever-decreasing volume of 'normal' cargoes moving south-east towards croatia. independence has, above all, brought peace to slovenia and left it free to implement the kind of rational market reforms and privatisation policies which remain blocked in the republics absorbed and impoverished by war further south. economists, however, are quick to point out that independence has its costs. slovenia, with its self- contained infrastructure and proximity to western markets, was always by far the richest republic of the former federation. its per capita gdp of around dollars 6,000 was three times higher than that of serbia and five times that of kosovo, the poorest region of the former yugoslavia. slovenia has always had a strong tourism industry of its own. but it also benefited from the overnight stays of foreign tourists heading further south to croatia's dalmatian coast. now the once-thriving seaside hotels are filled with discons- olate refugees and croatia's main source of hard currency income has disappeared. so have the transit tourists through slovenia. above all, slovene enterprises were able to build up exports to the rest of europe, thanks to the volume of sales they were able to make in yugoslavia which virtually gave them a 22m strong domestic market. the un embargo on trade with serbia means both the loss of the largest of the former yugoslav markets and an end to", "label": ["former yugoslavia", "independence", "rational market reforms", "privatisation policies", "slovene enterprises", "normal economic ties", "slovenian economy", "former federation", "slovene border"], "stemmed_label": ["former yugoslavia", "independ", "ration market reform", "privatis polici", "sloven enterpris", "normal econom tie", "slovenian economi", "former feder", "sloven border"]}

'at the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. the real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the uk underwriters. royal insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than pounds 20m. among other uk insurers, mr hill estimated that general accident may face losses of up to pounds 30m, while guardian royal exchange faced pounds 5m and sun alliance and commercial union pounds 10m each. however, hurricane andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the gulf of mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards new orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the alabama port of mobile and the louisiana-texas border, probably tomorrow night or early thursday. it could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the gulf of mexico. shell oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. a substantial part of america's oil refining industry is concentrated on the gulf coast, in louisiana and texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. andrew, the first caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. it ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the gulf. a million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern florida as the hurricane moved in from the bahamas on sunday. the florida power and light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. some", "label": ["hurricane andrew", "southern florida", "new orleans", "severe property damage", "damage claims", "insurance industry losses", "florida"], "stemmed_label": ["hurrican andrew", "southern florida", "new orlean", "sever properti damag", "damag claim", "insur industri loss", "florida"]}

{"doc": "the world bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country's efforts to fight poverty, according to an operational directive to staff issued today by mr lewis preston, the bank's president. the link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to make poverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990s. the shift in priorities is also reflected in a commitment to make comprehensive assessments of the nature and extent of poverty in the third world, allowing the bank to design more effective policies to fight poverty. in the directive, mr preston says poverty reduction is 'the benchmark by which our performance as a development institution will be measured'. he adds that the new instructions to staff are intended to 'ensure that these policies are fully reflected in the bank's operations'. the bank is also publishing a handbook containing examples of past best practice on poverty reduction. the bank says poverty assessments should be available for most developing countries within two years. these would form the basis for a 'collaborative approach to poverty reduction by country officials and the bank'. the directive signals an attempt to impose a form of 'social conditionality' on borrowing countries. 'stronger government commitment to poverty reduction warrants greater support; conversely, weaker commitment to poverty reduction warrants less support,' it says. mr preston's emphasis on poverty is a reaction to bank policies in the 1980s, when the aim was to improve economic efficiency in developing countries. the new directive says structural adjustment lending in the past decade 'overshadowed the bank's poverty reduction objectives'. the bank is also reacting to new evidence suggesting that the number of poor in developing countries will rise during the 1990s, rather than stabilise as had been expected. poverty his judge, page 34", "label": ["third world", "world bank", "loan volume", "poverty relief", "poverty alleviation", "poverty assessments", "bank policies", "poverty reduction objectives"], "stemmed_label": ["third world", "world bank", "loan volum", "poverti relief", "poverti allevi", "poverti assess", "bank polici", "poverti reduct object"]}

{"doc": "negotiations for a new contract between botswana, the world's most important diamond producer in value terms, and de beers, the south african group which controls 80 per cent of the market for rough (uncut) diamonds, are taking much longer than expected. the previous three-year contract ended on december 31. some botswana politicians want to change de beers' exclusive sales contract so that part of their country's output can be sold independently of the south african group's international cartel. this would give botswana its own 'market window' to see what its diamonds are worth in the free market. de beers is resisting any change. mr nicholas oppenheimer, chairman of the group's central selling organisation, argues that if botswana chose not to sell its production exclusively through his organisation, the cso's ability to regulate the distribution of rough diamonds would be compromised. he said: 'because the major (diamond) producers freely consent to sell exclusively through one channel, the cso is able to preserve an orderly market by matching rough diamond sales closely to consumer demand.' however, idc (holdings), a london-based group which claims to be the most experienced and substantial dealer in rough diamonds independent of the cso suggests the cso's attitude 'is unreasonable and based on a conceptual argument with little substance in fact.' in presentations to botswana's minerals policy committee and members of parliament, idc has been arguing that, not only was it commercially essential for botswana to understand the real value of its diamond output but that the country had a political responsibility to do so. 'data accumulated independently of the cso would put botswana in a position to have more input into the arrangements for the sale of its diamonds,' idc pointed out. 'on a political level this would enable the government to answer its critics or its electors with confidence and sure knowledge when questioned about arrangements for the disposal of the country's mineral assets.' if botswana were to sell 10 per cent of its rough diamond production, worth about usdollars 100m, independently of the cso - which sells about dollars 4bn-worth a year from all over the world - it would represent no threat to market stability, idc said. it claims analysts have estimated that 50 per cent of de beers' diamond profits in 1989 came from botswana. 'this profit is disproportionate to the sale of diamonds by debswana (de beers' subsidiary in botswana) to the cso as a percentage of the cso's total sales profits,' idc says. 'it is not unreasonable to reflect whether the fact that botswana is the only major producer currently selling 100 per cent of its production to the cso has any bearing on the substantial profits made by the cso on the sale of its diamonds.' other substantial producers such as the soviet union, angola, zaire and australia do not sell all their production to the cso and therefore have access to independent market information. idc does have a vested interest. it already markets diamonds for producers in guinea, guyana, brazil and the central african republic, and is offering to do some", "label": ["individual diamond producer", "botswana politicians", "de beers", "south african group", "exclusive sales contract", "central selling organisation", "rough diamond sales", "diamond trade", "botswana diamonds", "rough diamond output", "contract negotiations"], "stemmed_label": ["individu diamond produc", "botswana politician", "de beer", "south african group", "exclus sale contract", "central sell organis", "rough diamond sale", "diamond trade", "botswana diamond", "rough diamond output", "contract negoti"]}

'we will not renege on repaying this debt,' said mr andrej klemencic, adviser to slovenia's ministry of finance. the debt-service ratio is about 40 per cent of slovenia's gdp. last year's gdp amounted to dollars 13.5bn. mr jose mencinger, a member of the board of slovenia's central bank, said servicing that debt should not be a problem. 'last year, our exports totalled dollars 3.8bn. that is a decline of only 5 per cent compared to the year before. so, we are not in such a bad position with regard to servicing the debt,' he said. however, negotiating what share of the unallocated federal debt slovenia should assume is already proving difficult. the unallocated federal debt - which consists of loans to the nby, or the federal government which had not been specifically earmarked for projects in any of the six republics of the former yugoslavia - amounts to dollars 3.5bn. slovene officials say they are committed to repaying its share of the unallocated federal debt. mr kranjec says that the bank of slovenia has already proposed negotiations on this issue, as well as trying to discuss the status of the nby's foreign exchange reserves, the clearing balances with the countries of the former cmea socialist trading organisation, and operations of banks. 'this is going to take a long time to settle,' said mr kranjec. he and other slovene economists now believe that the european community-sponsored peace conference on yugoslavia could play a role in negotiating issues related to the debt. resolution of these issues, and recognition by the us of slovenia would speed the republic's admission to the international monetary fund and other financial institutions.", "label": ["national bank of yugoslavia", "foreign creditors", "independence", "foreign exchange deposits", "slovene banks", "slovene citizens", "federal government", "yugoslavia", "slovene banks", "unallocated federal debt", "negotiations"], "stemmed_label": ["nation bank of yugoslavia", "foreign creditor", "independ", "foreign exchang deposit", "sloven bank", "sloven citizen", "feder govern", "yugoslavia", "sloven bank", "unalloc feder debt", "negoti"]}

{"doc": "article by nigel hawkes, science editor: \"zoo antelope catch mad cow disease\" scientists at london zoo have discovered that a strain of \"mad cow disease\" affecting a type of antelope can be transmitted much more easily than was thought. the finding uncovers a threat to breeding other species in captivity unless it can be shown that they are not equally vulnerable. the scientists say there is no evidence that similar transmission is occurring among cows. the zoo's small herd of kudu, spiral-horned antelopes closely related to cows, has been severely hit by a disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse). of eight animals born in the herd since 1987, five have contracted the disease. only one of the five could have eaten feed containing protein from sheep believed to be the origin of the outbreak. the kudu is not the only zoo species to suffer the disease since it appeared in cows. it has also been found in domestic cats and their larger relations, the cheetah and the puma, in eland and nyala, and in the gemsbok and the arabian oryx. in the united states, mink have been affected by it. the infective agent and its mode of transmission are unknown but the evidence from kudu suggests that some species may be more easily infected than others. sheep are believed to catch the disease by contact with placentas in fields after births but in the case of the kudu even this route seems unlikely. in the veterinary record, the scientists eliminate most routes of infection. infected feed cannot account for four cases. nor can at least three of the affected animals have caught the disease from their mothers, who did not suffer from it. it is possible but unlikely that the mothers were carriers that passed on the infection without having symptoms themselves. if this were so, it would have important implications for the disease in cows. it is more likely, the scientists believe, that an unidentified agent entered the herd in contaminated feed and was passed along, as with more mundane infections. because of the danger to other animals, the kudu herd has been isolated. another danger taken seriously by the zoo, a world centre for breeding rare and endangered species, is that animals bred in captivity could carry the infection when released into the wild. if they proved as vulnerable as the kudu, this could be disastrous. the scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows. if it is, the conclusion would be that the kudu were simply more susceptible to the disease. if, however, it turned out to be a different and more easily transmittable form the case for isolating the kudu would be even stronger. times newspapers limited, 1993", "label": ["mad cow disease", "london zoo", "kudu herd", "affected animals", "similar transmission", "endangered species"], "stemmed_label": ["mad cow diseas", "london zoo", "kudu herd", "affect anim", "similar transmiss", "endang speci"]}

{"doc": "lawmakers clashed thursday over the question of counting illegal aliens in the 1990 census, debating whether following the letter of the constitution results in a system that is unfair to citizens. the forum was a census subcommittee hearing on bills which would require the census bureau to figure out whether people are in the country legally and, if not, to delete them from the counts used in reapportioning seats in the house of representatives. ``this is a fairness issue,'' said rep. thomas j. ridge, r-pa. who contended that states with large numbers of illegal aliens benefit unfairly when their large population totals give then extra seats in the house. because there is a 435-seat limit, when one state gains a house member another must lose one. ridge cited the 1980 census, which estimated the number of illegal aliens at 2 million. the result, he said, was that georgia and indiana lost house seats to new york and california. subcommittee chairman mervyn m. dymally, d-calif., however, said he is unsure whether the bills backed by ridge and others are constitutional. the u.s. constitution requires the census bureau to cound all the ``persons'' in the country every 10 years for purposes of reapportionment. it doesn't specify citizens. ``i am disturbed by the implication that undocumented residents of the united states are not `persons,''' dymally said. noting that at times in the past blacks and indians have been excluded from participation in government, he commented: ``i do not want to return to a time when some human beings are considered less than equal in the eyes of the law.'' ``every census since the constitution was adopted has counted all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal aliens,'' added rep. don edwards, d-calif. ``it was never the intent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionment purposes.'' and rep. albert g. bustamente, d-texas, termed the worry over counting aliens ``hysterical,'' pointing out that the movement of americans into western and southern states has had a much larger effect on representation than the presence of aliens. the census bureau also opposes the bills, contending that the effort to determine who is an illegal alien could delay and complicate the count and that people would be unlikely to tell the truth anyway. but reps. tom petri, r-wis. and william f. goodling, r-pa. asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens' basic right to equal representation by giving greater voice in congress to states where the aliens live. and rep. tim valentine, d-n.c., contended that counting aliens ``in effect, is granting representation in congress to individuals who have entered this country by breaking the laws of the united states.''", "label": ["illegal aliens", "lawmakers", "census bureau", "house seats", "u.s. constitution", "representatives"], "stemmed_label": ["illeg alien", "lawmak", "censu bureau", "hous seat", "u.s. constitut", "repres"]}

'it appears to be another sign that the former de beers' chairman is taking a more active role in guiding the company through its current difficulties,' says the diamantaire newsletter today. de beers said yesterday that the visit by mr oppenheimer, accompanied by his son nicholas, was a private one originally arranged for august last year but postponed because of the coup d'etat in the former soviet union. however, it admitted that mr oppenheimer would be meeting senior officials from the russian diamond industry during his stay because he would be going to some of the big mines in siberia and would be present when de beers held the formal opening of its moscow office on september 8. de beers' london-based central selling organisation, which controls about 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, in 1990 signed a dollars 5bn, five-year sales contract with the former soviet union and at the same time advanced a loan of dollars 1bn. diamond stocks were moved from moscow to london as collateral for the loan. after the break-up of the soviet union the contract was continued with rosalmazzoloto, the russian gold and diamond organisation, and an exclusive sales agreement was later signed with yukutia, the area in eastern siberia where most russian diamonds are mined and which is now an autonomous republic in the russian federation. a cso spokesman said yesterday: 'the russian contract is working. everything is normal.' diamantaire points out that the russian parliament is to consider next month a plan to set up a state diamond centre under the control of the finance ministry and komdragmet, formerly know as gokhran, the moscow depository of diamonds. reports suggest that the diamond centre would have exclusive rights to buy all rough diamonds mined in the russian federation and it would also have a monopoly of sorting gem diamonds. these proposals are being opposed by the yakut government, which is backing a joint-stock company, almazy rossli (diamonds of russia), being set up with mr valery rudakov, formerly in charge of rosalmazzoloto, at its head. rosalmazzoloto is to be broken up. almazy rossli proposes to bring all the diamond industry's operations under one roof, says diamantaire. observers expect mr oppenheimer to bring his formidable negotiating skills to bear to ensure that de beers grip on the diamond market is in no way weakened by any changes in russia. meanwhile, the newsletter, which is available only to subscribers to diamond international magazine, also says that reports", "label": ["harry oppenheimer", "south africa", "beleaguered diamond industry", "unofficial exports", "russian diamond industry", "london-based central selling organisation", "yakut government", "rough diamonds", "russian diamonds", "exclusive sales agreement", "de beers", "state diamond centre", "russian federation"], "stemmed_label": ["harri oppenheim", "south africa", "beleagu diamond industri", "unoffici export", "russian diamond industri", "london-bas central sell organis", "yakut govern", "rough diamond", "russian diamond", "exclus sale agreement", "de beer", "state diamond centr", "russian feder"]}

{"doc": "some of this year's drought in the midwest may have been caused by ocean temperature abnormalities near the equator in the pacific ocean, according to a new computer study reported thursday. such droughts could be anticipated if the temperature abnormalities turn out to be predictable, one of the authors said in the report appearing in friday's issue of science magazine. the authors are kevin e. trenberth and grant w. branstator of the national center for atmospheric research in boulder, colo., and phillip a. arkin of the climate analysis center of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in camp springs, md. they noted that when asked what caused the drought that hit much of north america in 1988, meteorologists often reply ``the jet stream was displaced northward of its usual position so that storms which tend to track along the path of the jet stream, were similarly displaced northward.'' ``such an answer is, however, just a brief description of the weather patterns associated with the drought but does not get at the cause. a more satisfying response would address why the jet stream was displaced northward,'' the team wrote. their proposed answer focuses on the development in april, may and june of drought in the midwest, where several states recorded less rain than at any time since 1895. by july the weather pattern they studied was breaking up, and continuing dryness in the study area and elsewhere probably had other causes, arkin said. but during the april-june period there were alternating high and low pressure centers across much of the northern half of the western hemisphere: a high-pressure center north of hawaii, a low in the gulf of alaska, a high in central canada extending down into the northern great plains states and a low on the east coast. in this period, pacific ocean temperatures ranged up to 5.4 degrees fahrenheit below normal in a narrow band extending about 4,000 miles along the equator westward from the coast of south america, with the coolest spot midway along the band. at the same time, a bit to the north of this band, surface temperatures ranged up to 0.9 degrees above normal. when this temperature pattern was fed into the computer, the pattern of stationary alternating high and low pressure systems was reproduced. the below-normal equatorial temperature by itself did not give such a result. ``we haven't proved anything; all we've done is shown that it's a possibility,'' arkin said. the global atmosphere is so complicated that repeated running of a more detailed computer model would be needed to show that these abnormal temperatures are likely to be associated with drought, he said. if the model holds up, the work will be the first demonstration of tropical sea surface temperatures affecting weather outside the tropics in the summer, arkin said. the authors took note of computer models predicting increased frequency of drought with the buildup of the ``greenhouse effect'' global warming caused by accumulation of gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. ``the greenhouse effect may tilt the balance such that conditions for droughts and", "label": ["droughts", "midwest", "ocean temperature abnormalities", "atmospheric research", "weather patterns", "pacific ocean temperatures", "new computer study", "temperature abnormalities"], "stemmed_label": ["drought", "midwest", "ocean temperatur abnorm", "atmospher research", "weather pattern", "pacif ocean temperatur", "new comput studi", "temperatur abnorm"]}

{"doc": "the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow' disease - which has killed more than 100,000 animals in the uk - is causing a new wave of public concern. new cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of creutzfeld-jacob disease, a brain disorder similar to bse. richard lacey, a microbiology professor at leeds university and the leading critic of government policy on bse, said the deaths this year of two farmers whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to chance. he believes that bse can trigger human brain disease. 'our worst predictions are coming true,' he said. 'i find it unbelievable that the government and their hand-picked advisers can go on telling the public there is no danger.' the advisers, led by the government's chief medical officer kenneth calman and chief veterinary officer keith meldrum, put out a detailed statement to justify their view that last month's death of 65-year-old duncan templeman - following that of peter warhurst, 61, a year ago - showed 'no features that give cause for undue concern'. the official view is that the deaths are an unfortunate coincidence, even though it is statistically unlikely that two dairy farmers should contract a disease as rare as cjd. robert will of edinburgh's western general hospital who has been monitoring cjd in the uk since 1990 on behalf of the health department, calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of even a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with bse-affected herds. one argument put forward by the health department is that cjd has such a long incubation period - typically 10 to 20 years - that clinical symptoms would not yet have appeared, even if bse had triggered any cases of cjd. 'since the illness of the cows (in templeman's herd) and the patient occurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,' the health department said. 'it is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between the cases of bse and the occurrence of disease in the patient.' another reassuring argument is that both farmers showed clinical features typical of the 'sporadic form' of cjd - of unknown cause - that usually occurs in late middle age. the handful of patients known to have developed cjd through infection (from contaminated human growth hormone) showed a different pattern of symptoms. the second annual report of will's national cjd surveillance unit in edinburgh, published last month, shows what looks at first sight like a disturbing rise in incidence: from 32 uk cases in the year ended april 1991 to 37 in 1991/92 and 46 in 1992/3. but the report says that this is not statistically significant and is probably due to increasing awareness of cjd (some cases were previously attributed to alzheimer's or other forms of dementia). meanwhile, cattle are succumbing to bse at a rate of about one per 100 every year. the epidemic continues", "label": ["mad cow disease", "bse", "bovine spongiform encephalopathy", "public concern", "human brain disease", "maternal transmission", "scrapie-contaminated feed", "epidemic"], "stemmed_label": ["mad cow diseas", "bse", "bovin spongiform encephalopathi", "public concern", "human brain diseas", "matern transmiss", "scrapie-contamin feed", "epidem"]}

'it is not an impressive bureaucracy,' says mr john williamson, a senior fellow at the institute for international economics. 'the morale of staff is lousy,' says mr charles flickner, a senior analyst on the senate budget committee and close observer of the bank. mr conable, a former republican congressman, arrived at the bank in 1986 knowing little about either banking or development. although now well-liked (partly for championing causes such as women's rights in the third world), many observers say he never fully recovered from a rocky start involving a divisive internal reorganisation of the bank. mr percy mistry, a scholar at queen elizabeth house, oxford, and former senior adviser at the bank, says it suffered from 'presidential failure' during the 1980s. mr robert mcnamara, a forceful chief executive in the 1970s, built a presidential institution that responded to firm leadership from the top. but neither mr conable nor his predecessor, mr a w 'tom' clausen, a commercial banker, could fill his shoes. for a decade the bank has effectively been run by two senior - and strong-willed - vice-presidents: mr ernest stern (who nearly left last year to join the ebrd) and mr moeen qureshi. mr preston's first challenge, says mr mistry, will be to wrest control of the bank from messrs stern and qureshi; his second, to prune legions of 'useless advisers' and install managers with real-world experience. his third, one might add, will be quickly to establish his independence from the us treasury which always browbeats a newcomer. what", "label": ["third world", "lewis preston", "poverty alleviation", "world bank", "washington", "president", "loan conditions"], "stemmed_label": ["third world", "lewi preston", "poverti allevi", "world bank", "washington", "presid", "loan condit"]}

{"doc": "the welfare state, the glue that binds the social fabric of the world's advanced capitalist economies, is coming unstuck. the immediate cause is its increasing cost at a time when budget deficits burden most of the 24 member states of the organisation for economic co-operation and development. rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of gdp across the oecd between 1989 and 1992. in the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years. while short-term measures may ease the immediate budgetary pressures, more fundamental reforms will be needed if the welfare state is not to undermine the economic performance that has underpinned its enormous expansion since the second world war. reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the oecd, as countries struggle to rein in government spending. total government spending in the oecd countries has risen from 28.1 per cent of gdp in 1960 to 43.8 per cent in 1990. the biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare unemployment benefits and family support. social security payments more than doubled during this period, from 7 per cent of gdp to 15.4 per cent. health expenditure also doubled, from 3.9 per cent to 7.8 per cent. the largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of publicly provided pensions. expenditure has risen rapidly in recent decades more than doubling its average share of gdp in oecd countries since 1960. pensions typically account for about a quarter of the increase in public expenditure over this period. the growth is largely attributable to three factors: the increase in coverage as pension schemes introduced after the second world war mature. the rise in the number of elderly people. improvements in pension benefits, such as automatic increases to match rising earnings. the maturing of the welfare state is also a significant factor in the doubling of health expenditure since 1960. countries such as spain, ireland and the netherlands have been extending their public healthcare systems to provide universal coverage. as with pensions, health systems have become more generous in the wake of economic growth - for example, including grafts and transplants that were previously regarded as experimental. the ageing of the population has also contributed to rising costs, though not as much as for pensions. rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families. but it has also helped to push up the budget for sickness and invalidity benefits, which often offer an escape route into early retirement for older workers. most oecd countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main areas of welfare spending during the 1980s, and have introduced policies to tackle the underlying causes. for example, governments have become much less willing to offer improvements in pensions. moves are afoot in countries such", "label": ["welfare reform", "welfare costs", "budget deficits", "president clinton", "healthcare reforms", "national welfare systems"], "stemmed_label": ["welfar reform", "welfar cost", "budget deficit", "presid clinton", "healthcar reform", "nation welfar system"]}

{"doc": "president bill clinton's pledge to 'end welfare as we know it' was one of the most popular lines in last year's election campaign. his idea of a strict two-year time limit on welfare cheques appealed to voters (especially 'reagan democrats') not just as a way of cutting government spending and thus reducing taxes, but as a solution to the nation's most pressing social problems. in the american mind, welfare has become synonymous with such evils as urban decay, fatherless children, drug abuse and violent crime. by promising radical welfare reform, mr clinton was sending a powerful subliminal message: he would wage war on all the diseases that are ravaging urban society. since becoming president, mr clinton has barely mentioned the word welfare raising fears that his grandiose promise will prove as cynical as former president george bush's 'read my lips: no new taxes' pledge. the white house insists that welfare reform is not forgotten but has just had to take its turn behind two even more urgent priorities: the deficit reduction plan finally approved this month and the healthcare reform scheduled for september. it claims both measures will help shift people off welfare by 'making work pay.' the budget advanced this cause by expanding the earned income tax credit (a kind of negative income tax). this gives poor working families a cash bonus of up to dollars 2,500 a year, increasing the incentive to take low paid jobs. if healthcare reform guarantees health insurance for all workers welfare recipients will no longer be able to reject jobs on the grounds that they stand to lose their health care benefits. in addition, the administration promises to bolster the economic position of welfare mothers by strictly enforcing laws requiring absent fathers to support their children financially. such measures should help. but they are hardly going to solve america's welfare problem, which differs substantially from that in europe. in keeping with franklin roosevelt's dictum that a permanent dole is 'a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit', the us has never provided permanent welfare support for single, able-bodied adults. when pundits talk of a 'culture of welfare' they are referring mainly to the dollars 20bn spent on aid for families with dependent children, a benefit received by 5m single-parent families. the objection is not that some families in straitened circumstances need afdc as a short-term prop, but that half of those on welfare behave as though they have a meal ticket for life. so what should mr clinton do? many conservatives favour the concept of a strict time limit. once people accept that benefits are not going to be paid indefinitely, they argue behaviour will change. teenagers will stop having babies and start recognising the economic advantages of marriage. those whose welfare benefits expire will face a stark choice: accept low-paid employment or hand over children for adoption. at first the adjustment will be horribly painful but in the longer term society will gain enormously because destructive lifestyles will no longer be underwritten. with its economic life support system (welfare) ripped away, the underclass", "label": ["welfare reform", "president bill clinton", "federal assistance", "welfare benefits", "welfare problems", "healthcare reform", "deficit reduction"], "stemmed_label": ["welfar reform", "presid bill clinton", "feder assist", "welfar benefit", "welfar problem", "healthcar reform", "deficit reduct"]}

{"doc": "the names will be different, but more hurricanes with the powerful punches of hugo and gilbert may be prowling the atlantic, caribbean and gulf of mexico in the future. \"the probability of more intense hurricanes in the atlantic region is greater in the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and '80s,\" says meteorologist william m. gray of colorado state university, who analyzes hurricane patterns. gray predicts a possible return of the more ferocious hurricanes of the '50s and '60s, because of an apparent break in the periodic west african drought. rainfall in the sahel, typically associated with more intense hurricane activity, was above average in 1988 for the first time since 1969, he says. a second rainy summer this year indicates an end to the drought. the most intense hurricanes, gray explains, usually form at low latitudes from tropical disturbances moving westward from africa. the well-watered conditions in the '50s and '60s produced 31 of the most severe kind (categories 4 and 5) in the 17-year period 1950 to 1967. hurricanes are classified by the saffir-simpson scale, the fiercest a no. 5, or catastrophic storm. the atmospheric pressure at its center drops drastically and its wind speed exceeds 155 m.p.h. in the drier 17-year period of 1970 to 1987, there were only 13 severe storms. in the '88 and '89 seasons -- june through november -- there have been five. last year's gilbert, which left a wide swath of devastation across jamaica and the mexican yucatan, was the mightiest hurricane on record in the western hemisphere. its atmospheric pressure dropped to 885 millibars and its wind speed reached 200 m.p.h. this september's hugo, which ripped through the virgin islands and puerto rico before clobbering south carolina, had sustained winds of 150 m.p.h. and an atmospheric pressure of 918 millibars (27.1 inches). officially a 4 on the saffir-simpson scale, it \"may be a borderline 5,\" says meteorologist mark zimmer of the national hurricane center in miami. the strongest recorded storm on earth, zimmer says, was 1979 typhoon tip in the western pacific, with a low pressure of 870 millibars. outside the atlantic area and the eastern pacific, hurricanes are called typhoons or cyclones. fortunately, most atlantic-region hurricanes do not develop to their worst potential. in this century, only two no. 5 hurricanes have struck the united states with full force, the 1935 labor day storm that ravaged the florida keys and 1969's camille, which slammed ashore at mississippi and louisiana. in 1980, allen, the mightiest caribbean storm then recorded, had lost much of its punch before it hit the gulf coast of texas. \"if the future is like the past with its pattern of atmospheric conditions, there is a good probability of the return of stronger storms,\" gray said. but in the 1990s, he warns, u.s. destruction will be at least four to five times more costly than in the '50s and '60s, because of the boom in population and property development along coastal areas. the threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any yet", "label": ["intense hurricanes", "atlantic region", "hurricane patterns", "meteorologist william gray", "ferocious hurricanes", "catastrophic storm", "atmospheric conditions"], "stemmed_label": ["intens hurrican", "atlant region", "hurrican pattern", "meteorologist william gray", "feroci hurrican", "catastroph storm", "atmospher condit"]}

'with the tgv and the chunnel this region, which was sort of in the corner of europe, will now be in the middle of a new developing area,' he says. this is no bad thing for belgium. in its last economic survey of the country, the organisation for economic co-operation and development said the belgian economy had deteriorated 'progressively' since the 1980s. 'and over the last 10 to 12 months it has taken a distinct turn for the worse.' furthermore, flanders, the area most likely to benefit from the arrival of the tunnel, has recently suffered more rapid increases in unemployment than in wallonia and the brussels region. the unemployment rate, which in 1990 was 9.5 per cent in flanders has risen to 13 per cent. the belgian chambers in the regions most directly affected believe there are two main areas for development: firstly, increasing traffic through western flanders as holidaymakers and freight carriers head towards the tunnel-opening in calais; and secondly tourism. to benefit fully, however, a crucial 7km stretch of the e40 european motorway between veurne and the french border has yet to be completed. once this is done it will be possible to drive from russia to england without leaving a motorway, says mr philippe claerhout, chairman of the veurne chamber of commerce and industry. fortunately, plans to complete the stretch have been agreed and it should be open some time next year. on the downside, the westhoek region is badly placed to benefit from rail transport.

{"doc": "the calm waters of prince william sound have stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in u.s. history, which spewed from a ship that ran aground trying to avoid chunks of ice, officials said. the spill of some 270,000 barrels _ or 11.3 million gallons _ occurred early friday when the 987-foot tanker exxon valdez went hard aground on bligh reef, about 25 miles outside valdez, the northermost ice-free port in the united states. coast guard spokesman ed wieliczkiewicz said the use of chemicals to disperse and sink the heavy north slope crude oil failed because the agents depend in part on rough seas to break up the oil. he said exxon officials plan to pump the oil remaining aboard the exxon valdez onto the exxon baton rouge, another tanker. early friday the exxon valdez was losing 20,000 gallons of oil per hour, but the flow slowed to a trickle later. an oil slick snaked about five miles from the ship as wind and tide pushed the crude oil into the sound and away from shore. ``this is the largest oil spill in u.s. history and it unfortunately took place in an enclosed water body with numerous islands, channels, bays and fiords,'' said richard golob, publisher of the golob oil pollution bulletin. gov. steve cowper said the ship was ``impaled on the reef.'' he said the vessel steered from its course to avoid chunks of ice and did not return to its normal traffic lane. dan lawn, an engineer for the state department of environmental conservation, said the captain could not steer the exxon valdez back on course in time to avoid a collision. lawn likened the ship's situation to ``trying to park a cadillac in a volkswagen spot.'' divers were to check the ship's hull and their findings were to be used in making plans for the removal of crude oil still aboard the vessel. ``a spill of this size in such a complex environment promises to be a cleanup nightmare,'' said golob, a cambridge, mass.-based consultant whose firm has studied oil spills and environmental disasters for 15 years. in washington, interior department spokesman steve goldstein said efforts had begun to evacuate waterfowl, sea otters and other wildlife from the danger area. the exxon valdez had loaded 1.2 million barrels of oil at the alyeska pipeline service co. marine terminal at valdez and was en route to long beach, calif., when it crunched onto the reef. the ship marks the second aniversary of its maiden voyage today. the terminal was closed early friday to tanker traffic as officials tried to deal with the mammoth spill. the flow in the trans-alaska oil pipeline also was reduced to 800,000 barrels daily from 1.2 million barrels. alyeska spokesman tom brennan said that, at the reduced rate the marine terminal's capacity would allow nine days of operation before the line would have to be shut down. valdez, a town of about 3,000 year-round residents that grows to more than 4,000 with a summer influx of fishing industry workers and travelers, is a picturesque community", "label": ["u.s. tanker spill", "oil spills", "987-foot tanker exxon valdez", "bligh reef", "oil slick", "environmental conservation", "crude oil", "environmental disasters"], "stemmed_label": ["u.s. tanker spill", "oil spill", "987-foot tanker exxon valdez", "bligh reef", "oil slick", "environment conserv", "crude oil", "environment disast"]}
{"doc": "turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at venetia de beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from south africa's borders with botswana and zimbabwe. only weeks before the mine came into production in july 1992 at a cost of usdollars 400m, de beers' central selling organisation, which controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, imposed quotas on its producer-suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from angola. for a time venetia, the first mine of any sort in south africa to gain permission for seven-day working, moved to a five-day week. this year it has gone back to seven-day working as the quotas were eased so that the cso is now accepting 85 per cent of the diamonds it contracted to take from producers. however, there is still turmoil in the diamond market caused by uncertainty about russian exports following 'leaks' of stones from that country outside its contract with the cso. consequently, mr hans gastrow, general manager, says that this year venetia will process 4.3m tonnes of ore, 6.5 per cent below its capacity. it is also mining an area of lower grade ore, which has fewer diamonds in each tonne. mr gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be well below the 5.6m carats a year de beers predicted venetia would yield at full production. last year the mine, building up rapidly, more than doubled output and processed 3.6m tonnes of ore to recover 4.96m carats. about 70 per cent of venetia's diamonds are of gem quality and analysts suggest that at dollars 100 a carat on average the mine is generating annual sales of about dollars 500m. mr gastrow says that, apart from the imposition of the cso quota, venetia 'has made a remarkably smooth transition from construction to production'. this year will be a time of consolidation. he insists that the quota is having no impact on employment. nevertheless venetia originally was to have employed 870 and it now has 764. a mine of venetia's size in the past would have employed 2,000. the total has been kept down here partly by highly automated process plant but also by 'fewer people employed just to see that other people are doing their jobs' according to mr david gadd-claxton, ore extraction manager. venetia was the first new south african diamond mine for 25 years. it is also the country's biggest diamond mine and a major contributor of export earnings. the mine has also revitalised de beers' production, as it is accounting for half the group's output in south africa and replacing production from its 100-year-old kimberley mines, which are now fading away. venetia's success is strategically important to de beers because, when its output is added to that in botswana and namibia, it gives the group direct control over more than 50 per cent of world rough gem diamond output. this provides a major base for the cso to work from and gives it a powerful position from which to negotiate with other producers in the diamond", "label": ["global diamond markets", "central selling organisation", "diamond cartel", "rough gem diamond output", "turbulence", "south african diamond mine", "venetia", "de beers", "russian exports"], "stemmed_label": ["global diamond market", "central sell organis", "diamond cartel", "rough gem diamond output", "turbul", "south african diamond mine", "venetia", "de beer", "russian export"]}

{"doc": "it is ironic that there is an unprecedented, greedy rush for diamonds by miners in angola and canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is in turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the world's most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market. in canada's northwest territories, the discovery of 81 small diamonds, some of gem quality, has sparked the biggest rush to stake mining claims in the history of the north american industry. stakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large and prospectors have claimed every piece of land within 300 km (185 miles) of the discovery. in spite of all this hectic activity, it is very unlikely that anyone will find enough big diamonds to make the development of canada's first diamond mine worthwhile. the odds in favour of making a fortune are much better for the diamond hunters in angola. more than dollars 1m-worth of gem diamonds a day are being smuggled out of that country for sale in antwerp. an estimated 50,000 private-enterprise diggers are at work already and their numbers are being swelled by 500 a day. this rise of illegal mining particularly in the cuango region, which produces 80 per cent of angola's diamonds and some of its highest-quality gem stones, started in may, 1991 after the peace accord which allowed freedom of movement for the first time in 16 years. as well as experienced miners, many soldiers who could not find civilian jobs have made their way to the diamond areas. the onset of the dry season and the fall in river levels from the end of may this year has encouraged what de beers, the south african group that dominates the world diamond business, describes as 'a sudden and unprecedented explosion in the supply of illicit angolan diamonds reaching the market'. even though there are so many diggers at work, questions are being asked about whether there might be more to this 'explosion.' did unita, angola's rebel movement, build up a stockpile which is now being released? is endiama, angola's state-owned diamond company, implicated in some way? in the murky world of diamond dealing such rumours abound. de beers probably knows the answers because its intelligence network is remarkable. what is also remarkable is that all those scrambling for diamonds in angola or dropping out of the skies to stake expensive claims in canada take it for granted that the diamond cartel will be able to continue to keep prices up and make all their efforts worthwhile. the cartel has survived partly because nobody needs diamonds. they are composed of very hard carbon so they can be useful for drilling holes in tough material, but there are substitutes for this use. gem diamonds are solely for decoration and serve no useful purpose. but the cartel has ensured that rough (uncut) diamond prices have risen steadily since the 1930s - even when in the depths of the 1981-86 recession the price of a top-quality, one carat gem diamond slumped in the retail market", "label": ["world diamond business", "rough diamond production", "diamond market", "diamond sales", "london-based central selling organisation", "diamond prices", "diamond cartel", "canada", "greedy rush", "first diamond mine", "diamond hunters"], "stemmed_label": ["world diamond busi", "rough diamond product", "diamond market", "diamond sale", "london-bas central sell organis", "diamond price", "diamond cartel", "canada", "greedi rush", "first diamond mine", "diamond hunter"]}

{"doc": "the smoke has cleared a little. after seven long years, the us congress this week passed its first significant gun control law since the assassinations of mr robert kennedy and rev martin luther king jr in 1968. the legislation - known as the brady bill after mr james brady, the former white house press secretary severely wounded in an assassination attempt on president ronald reagan - would impose a five-day waiting period on purchases of handguns. it would give law enforcement authorities time to check the buyer's background. advocates of tougher controls on guns were jubilant about their victory over stubborn resistance by republican senators from western states such as idaho and alaska, who have long opposed any restriction on gun ownership in the us. the brady bill's opponents in congress say it will inconvenience only law-abiding citizens, not criminals who buy or steal their weapons away from the government's prying eyes. they point to glaring failings in the federal government's policing of the 276,000 licensed gun dealers in the us as evidence of the brady bill's likely ineffectiveness. for instance, one newspaper reporter successfully obtained a dealer's licence for his dog by submitting a made-up social security number. studies of state laws requiring some form of background check suggest however, that at least some sales to convicted felons have been stopped, and some suspected criminals have been caught when they tried to buy a gun. but even the most ardent supporters of the brady bill acknowledge that it will make no more than a dent in the estimated 7.5m legal sales each year of new or used firearms, let alone the approximately 200m guns in circulation; and will barely affect the more than 14,000 murders and 1,400 accidental deaths involving guns each year. 'the longest journey begins with a single step,' mr brady said after the bill's final passage in the senate on wednesday. despite its uncertain effect, passage of the brady bill is read by some as a sign that the tide has turned decisively in favour of gun control. other initiatives in congress and in state legislatures are under way: the senate last week agreed in a separate bill to ban assault weapons, a measure already in force in california, new jersey and connecticut. virginia has passed a law restricting people to one gun purchase a month. with the federal government considering the imposition of punitive taxes on some particularly devastating types of ammunition, the winchester company recently decided to withdraw its black talon bullet. this is prized by some game hunters for its killing power but detested by emergency room doctors for the damage it inflicts on humans as it mushrooms on impact. the strength of public feeling about rampant gun use has clearly grown in the face of an apparently unstoppable wave of urban violence that has brought the rate of death by shooting among young black men to more than 150 per 100,000, and led to the installation of metal detectors in city schools. the fear of violent crimes such as carjackings and drive-by shootings has", "label": ["gun control law", "brady bill", "complete ban", "us congress", "gun purchase", "restriction", "gun ownership"], "stemmed_label": ["gun control law", "bradi bill", "complet ban", "us congress", "gun purchas", "restrict", "gun ownership"]}
{"doc": "investors are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the river limpopo in zimbabwe, which de beers, the south african group that dominates the diamond business, discovered but then let get away. the mine is river ranch, 12km upstream from beitbridge on the southern border of zimbabwe. de beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to concentrate instead on another site 60km away and, importantly, given the heat generated by the politics of the region, across the border in south africa. after an investment of dollars 500m that site went into production as venetia, one of the world's biggest diamond mines. the south african group eventually gave up its rights to river ranch in 1991 after it failed to reach agreement with the zimbabwe government about marketing the diamonds. the government insists that all minerals are sold through its state-controlled minerals marketing corporation. mr robin baxter-brown, chairman of redaurum red lake mines, one of the new joint owners of river ranch, said yesterday that de beers bulldozed the site before leaving. also, all documentation about the deposit has mysteriously disappeared from the zimbabwe ministry of mines. (a de beers official said equipment would usually be removed from a site before it was abandoned but he could neither confirm nor deny that river ranch had been bulldozed.) mr baxter-brown is a south african geologist who started his career with de beers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience. he helped auridiam, an australian-quoted company that he co-founded and where he was once chairman, win the mining rights to river ranch when they were put up for tender by the zimbabwe government in 1991. the deposit is estimated by the joint venturers to have resources of 17.5m tonnes containing 5m carats of diamonds, and since mining started in march last year it has produced 43,000 carats of diamonds, 60 per cent of them of gem quality, mr baxter-brown said. redaurum, which is quoted in toronto, is raising cdollars 1.5m (pounds 780,000) net of expenses via a placing by london stockbrokers carr kitcatt &amp; aitken to help boost annual output from the present rate of 50,000 carats to 330,000 carats. the increase will be reached in two phases. the first, costing usdollars 2.1m, will raise output to 180,000 carats next year, while the second will cost dollars 8.7m. the partners have spent about dollars 850,000 to buy and move a heavy minerals separation plant recently decommissioned at the rtz corporation's diamond mine near mafikeng, 500km away. the joint venturers have exclusive exploration rights to 13,474 hectares of ground around the mine and mr baxter-brown suggested the chances of finding another diamond deposit were good. while most of river ranch's gem diamonds are small, typically under half a carat, the mine has yielded some big stones, the biggest so far being 29.6 carats. a 28-carat stone was sold for dollars 110,000 or dollars 4,000 a carat, and one of 17 carats for dollars 95,000 (dollars 6,000 a carat). diamonds are being sold directly to the market in antwerp, belgium, and not", "label": ["diamond business", "diamond mines", "zimbabwe government", "diamond exploration experience", "joint venturers", "exclusive exploration rights", "central selling organisation", "diamond trade", "diamond deposit", "river ranch", "south african group"], "stemmed_label": ["diamond busi", "diamond mine", "zimbabw govern", "diamond explor experi", "joint ventur", "exclus explor right", "central sell organis", "diamond trade", "diamond deposit", "river ranch", "south african group"]}

{"doc": "black americans suffer six times more tuberculosis than whites do, and one important reason appears to be a genetic susceptibility to the disease, according to a study today. the research found that when living conditions are identical black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the tb bacteria. the relatively high rate of tb among blacks has traditionally been blamed on crowded housing and other conditions of poverty. while social factors undoubtedly play a central role, the study suggests that innate susceptibility also contributes. ``we found that there is a systemic difference between whites and blacks,'' said dr. william w. stead. ``whites seem to be more able to fend off the organism without it's ever being able to establish an infection.'' stead, a tuberculosis specialist at the arkansas department of health, discovered the racial difference while analyzing health statistics from nursing homes and prisons. ``it's a very intriguing finding,'' commented dr. george comstock of johns hopkins university. ``i never quite believe anything until somebody replicates it. but i don't know of any real holes in this one.'' at the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases dr. george curlin called the findings ``plausible and provocative.'' however, he added: ``i'm scared to death that people are going to say this explains it all and forget everything else. of the total six times difference, what proportion is attributable to biology and what to social factors? i would say that biology is relatively minor.'' stead's study, published in the new england journal of medicine was based largely on a review of 25,398 elderly people who were free of tb infection when they were admitted to arkansas nursing homes. when they were retested at least two months later, 14 percent of blacks and 7 percent of whites showed evidence of new infections. prison data from arkansas and minnesota also found that black inmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch the bacteria while incarcerated. another soon-to-be published study reports the discovery of a racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the tb bacteria, which could help explain why blacks seem to be more prone to tuberculosis. about 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the united states, resulting in 1,700 deaths. in the population at large, tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as whites. an estimated 10 million americans are believed to be infected with the bacteria but not sick. the disease, which attacks the lungs, has long been associated with poor, crowded living conditions. stead's study found that blacks got infected more readily than whites, regardless of the race of the person who initially brought the infection into the nursing home. in homes where the initial source of the disease was white, 17 percent of blacks and 12 percent of whites caught the infection. when the primary source was black, 12 percent of blacks and 8 percent of whites contracted the bacteria. this phase of the study also suggests, however, that infected whites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks.", "label": ["tuberculosis", "black americans", "whites", "infectious diseases", "tb bacteria", "racial difference", "racial difference"], "stemmed_label": ["tuberculosi", "black american", "white", "infecti diseas", "tb bacteria", "racial differ", "racial differ"]}

(sonny) montgomery (d-miss.) \"this is a tremendous loss to his family, his state, and the nation.\" smith had thrown out the first ball at the dixie youth world series baseball tournament sunday and was heading home to gulfport, taking off at about 9:10 p.m. for the 35-minute flight. jack barker, a federal aviation administration spokesman here, said the plane \"lost radar contact\" at 9:25. he said area residents \"heard the airplane crash\" and notified officials. barker said visibility was 4 to 6 miles, and \"rain was reported, but not heavy.\" lamar breland told the associated press that \"my wife was preparing to go to bed, and we heard a plane coming over. i thought at the time it was unusual for a plane to be in the area at night.\" he said he heard a \"revving sound and then a crash.\" in miami, jorge prellezo, regional director of the national transportation safety board, said a team of investigators had been dispatched to the scene. investigators generally take months to establish a probable cause of such incidents. the plane belonged to the institute for marine mammal studies inc. in gulfport. the institute immediately issued a statement saying that smith had requested use of the plane \"to accommodate his busy schedule.\" jody canady, a spokeswoman, said smith was to reimburse the institute. the statement said the plane, manufactured in 1973, and purchased by the institute last year, had a \"current inspection.\" the pilot received", "label": ["airplane crash", "freshman congressman larkin smith", "light plane crash", "single-engine cessna 177", "wreckage", "mississippi", "aviation accident"], "stemmed_label": ["airplan crash", "freshman congressman larkin smith", "light plane crash", "single-engin cessna 177", "wreckag", "mississippi", "aviat accid"]}
{"doc": "two days of racially charged hearings on police brutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the nation's third-largest city show the new mayor must still heal some old wounds. richard m. daley was elected mayor april 4 amid fears by black activists that he would bring back the machine politics of his late father, richard j. daley, who was mayor for more than 20 years before his death in 1976. the younger daley emphasized empowerment of minorities in his spring campaign, and after defeating black challengers in the primary and general election, he named minorities to 11 of his 21 cabinet positions. but now daley finds himself on the defensive. some black politicians say the mayor is indirectly sanctioning racism by not doing enough to stop it. the racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special hearings called by a city council committee to look into allegations of police brutality against blacks. ``there's been no demonstrable change on the part of white leadership in this city to end racism,'' said bob starks, associate professor of inner city studies at northeastern illinois university. ``it's the same stuff, and it's seemingly getting worse.'' but daley maintains that what's getting worse is ``irresponsible political rhetoric'' from black politicians who are looking ahead to the 1991 mayoral election. daley is filling the remaining two years of the term of the late harold washington, the city's first black mayor who was just a few months into his second term when he died in november 1987. daley has denounced the alleged police brutality. ``i will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in the city of chicago,'' daley said. ``everyone should join together ... to help alleviate this problem.'' also last week, a human relations task force made up of business and civic leaders released a report saying racism in chicago was fueled by ``a shocking lack of contact'' between the city's ethnic groups. the report, based on a 15-month investigation of the city's race relations, concluded that racial divisions ``threaten to make chicago an increasingly unpleasant place to live and are antithetical to the city's economic growth and prosperity.'' at the city council hearings thursday and friday, blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers _ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs. among them was a 55-year-old grandmother, callie bryant, who testified that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven white police officers who gave her ``the sign of the ku klux klan.'' two teen-age boys testified that in august they were picked up by white officers, roughed up, and then dropped off in a white neighborhood where they were attacked by white youths. the poice department's record was defended by police superintendent leroy martin, a black appointee of washington. ``i'm the head of this police department, and if this police department is bad, it's because i'm bad as superintendent,'' martin said. ``when this police department is attacked, i must defend it. when it's", "label": ["police brutality", "racism", "race relations", "chicago", "racial issue", "blacks", "new mayor"], "stemmed_label": ["polic brutal", "racism", "race relat", "chicago", "racial issu", "black", "new mayor"]}
{"doc": "lightning has set the west ablaze this summer, and electricity is again surging through the nation's wildfire command post. ``the whole place is running at the max, full out,'' reed jarvis of the boise interagency fire center said last week. but this year is different because the center's strategists and quartermasters who direct the nation's wildfire battles can see some of the worst blazes from their windows. as nearly half the acreage afire burns within 150 miles specialists in the logistics center marshal resources from around the nation. on saturday, there were about 220,000 acres ablaze in four states, with 102,000 of them in idaho and the rest in oregon california and utah. ``tell me when the airplane's got to leave and i'll have the team on it,'' coordinator lynn findley says into the phone cradled on his shoulder. he hangs up, makes another call and arranges for a procurement expert to fly from atlanta to lagrande, ore. another staff member fields a caller searching for a fire officer called ``joe blow.'' ``can you believe it?'' she says over her shoulder. ``he spells his name b-l-o-u-g-h.'' others juggle as many as three of the constantly ringing phones scanning computer terminals for personnel, airplanes, red chemical retardant and gear. ``we drop slimy red mud on burning trees from antique airplanes,'' declares the slogan on one t-shirt. in one leg of the l-shaped logistics room, the intelligence division keeps track of fires around the country. the other finds the crews and equipment to attack the flames. a big chalkboard plots the fires as they eat up mile after mile of fuel. magnets resembling aircraft dot a map of the country, giving the location and type of equipment available. ``obviously, firefighting on the line is stressful,'' said fire center spokesman arnold hartigan. ``but the support people are dealing with human life facing fire, which is inherently dangerous.'' hundreds of fires burned fitfully in the idaho backcountry for days after the last ``lightning bust.'' one storm laid down 2,000 strikes an hour with little rain. then winds reaching 80 mph and temperatures pushing triple digits whipped those spots into major conflagrations. three-inch-thick burning branches blew up to two miles ahead of the main fires. flames swept over thousands of acres in several hours' time, creating a smoky miasma around idaho's capital city. the buzz at the wildfire nerve center intensified dramatically. ``fortunately we don't work at this level all year,'' hartigan said. ``it would be unbearable if we had to do this 365 days a year.'' the complex has taken on a military look. national guard troops in camouflage fatigues march toward trucks for transportation to the fire lines. smoke jumpers sit in the shade of a building waiting for their next leap into 100-foot-tall ponderosa pines laden with chainsaws or water pumps. ``we are definitely an assault organization,'' hartigan said. ``it's patterned after military operations because they work. we're the supply lines for the troops.'' in the logistics center, specialists spin lazy susans with pink and blue requisition forms as each plea from the fire", "label": ["wildfire battles", "worst blazes", "firefighting", "wildfire command post", "fire lines", "boise interagency fire center"], "stemmed_label": ["wildfir battl", "worst blaze", "firefight", "wildfir command post", "fire line", "bois interag fire center"]}
